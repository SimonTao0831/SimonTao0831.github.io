# Personal website

## About

Five years ago, I built my first personal website using [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). It was a blog-focused site, but since I was not used to blogginf, I later translated some of the content into English, and created my second personal page using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/). Over time, I became inspired to create my own website, which led to this third website entirely from scratch â€” developed by me with assistance from ChatGPT.
